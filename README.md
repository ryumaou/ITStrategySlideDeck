# ITStrategySlideDeck
A slide deck of empty slides for communicating IT strategy

This is a repository of single slides and a combined slide deck for PowerPoint, inspired by the book Technology Strategy Patterns; Architecture As Strategy by Eben Hewitt.  While these are mostly PowerPoint slides, some slides are also based on spreadsheets, which I'll include in the repository.  Also, since this is meant as a template for my own work which I'm sharing because I realize it may be helpful to others, the slides may be more generic than one might expect.  You get what you pay for!
